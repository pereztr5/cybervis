with there [live threat map](map.ipviking.com). This application is to show
what is going on during these cyber defense competitions. 

### Dependencies
- Argus
- Node.js
- Socket.io

This is currently being tested on a CentOS 6.6 box.

### Setup
- [Argus Setup](http://web.cs.sunyit.edu/~pereztr/argus_setup.html)  
- [Demo](http://pereztr5.github.io/network-visualization-project-log-2)

### About
There are two parts to this project: the server-side and the front-end.
This repo is being used to present the server-side code with some front-end
to test. This is a project being done for my NCS 490 Network Engineering
class at [SUNY Polytechnic Institute](http://sunypoly.edu). I intend to
continue to improve this project after the class and would appreciate any
suggestions and/or help especially with the front-end.
